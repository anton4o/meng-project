# IFML Modelling for Rapidly Prototyping Web Interfaces
*MEng Final Year Project for the Department of Computer Science at The University of York*

This repo consists of the files required to rapidly prototype an eCommerce website based on its IFML models.
The scope of the prototype is restricted to a single user journey - opening a product from the homepage of the generated web application, viewing the details of the product and adding it to the shopping cart.

* The /models folder contains the four IFML models required for the website, built with the Open Source IFML Editor.
* The /templates folder contains the four respective EGL templates that are used for the generation of the webpages comprising the web application.
* The /resurces folder contains the rest of the files from the MVP architecture of the generated prototype - these include the model of the web app in JSON format and four Presenters in JavaScript (one for each page) that handle the control logic of the generated applciation. 
* The /domain folder contains a rough UML metamodel of the domain instances in order to ease the modelling done with IFML.
